STRATEGY:
---------

* * *

Create an aesthetically pleasing, simple yet fast  open source user interface content sharing app that is easy to navigate. The site allows users to create their profile (including avatar, username and bio), and upload their own content including photos, titles and decriptions. Users can also view and interact with other users posts: liking, commenting and saving as favourites. Their favourites will all be displayed in their favourites page.


The site will allow for user authentification, and basic CRUD functionality.


The goal is to create a code that is clear and allows you to update with ease.

COLORS:

The color scheme used for this project were inspired by London Lash Pro's color pallette used in their website.
I used a little more black in the landing page as it feed into the Black Sales Theme. For example: alert banners, hero video, VIP sign up form.

TYPOGRAPHY:
---------

* * *

The Typography used by London Lash is FUTURA PT which is purchased by Adobe.
As I do not hold a license, for the purpose of this project I used Nunito, which is Google Fonts equivalent.

I also made use on the play of font-weight as used in the logo. Important words that are meant to stand out to the customers are in BOLD. 

Headers are uppercased and letter spacing is increased.

Font awesome icons were added, also inspired by the website. In this case I used the free ones, which can be replaced by the colored emoji's once purchased.
